          <p>...and we're up! I finally got around to updating my GitHub repo and now you're seeing the result of it all! I'm honestly surprised by the fact that this entire page isn't broken or messed up in some odd fashion seeing as I didn't account for differing resolutions or browsers when creating the styling on my laptop. It all seems to be in working condition though and now I can start focusing on populating the pages with whatever I find lying around in the archives.</p>
          <p>Maybe this is the start of a blog, the start of public web experiments, or nothing at all. Whatever it is that I do with this page I'll try and keep it all sorted out and avoid creating a tangled mess of a site.</p>
          <p>It's at this point of writing that I realise filling up an entire webpage is difficult. It's incredible how you can visit a news site and find a towering amount of text in a single article. Although it seems most sites like to squish the text in a column that's like 25% of the screen width and break up paragraphs with pictures or ads, anything that can fill up space. You know, I should probably do that to make the page seem more content rich! But what to use for that purpose... it's a tough call, but I'll see what I can find.</p>

          <p>Alright I think that's enough dilly-dallying it's time to end this post. In summary, I'm aiming to consistently update this site and create actual content. It'll be nice to have saved up if I ever need a portfolio and give me some further experience in programming. Please look forward to whatever I do next, and thank you for reading this mess of a post.</p>
