          <p>I've probably spent around 3 hours just trying to figure out how SSH keys work only to find out that you cannot use them for cloning repos and that when I was trying to commit with mine that it kept giving me an access error because I didn't have write access to the repo I tried to commit to! There's a lot that I can look back at now and realise that I was a complete idot for thinking that stuff worked a certain way, even when my terminal was telling me the exact issue I was facing.</p>
          <p>Also, this is just a test paragraph to see if I can actually use my two braincells to set up an SSH key and GPG key.</p>

          <p>Web development is hard and that should go without saying. This is the thought that kept repeating itself over and over last night as I was awake for hours when I thought about the things I'd have to do for this site. It's been six months since I last thought of this site and there has been something bothering me that has been a long time coming:</p>
          <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 0; font-style: italic;">"I do not have a website"</p>
          <p>Well, I guess it is only a half truth since this text is actually on a site, but when I say a website I mean a page that I am actually proud of and can show off. Every now and then I'll visit a site and go into my user settings to see if there's anything new. Every single time I do so there's a field that stares straight at me with anticipation, longing to be filled with something worthy and worthwhile: "Your Website". I have to stop in my tracks and think of what I would put there.</p>
          <p>Over the past years I've embarked upon countless endeavors that at the time felt like the most important thing in the world. These projects were something that I had to dedicate my time to and finish, but now I can only faintly remember them. It is here that I wonder where those projects are, were they worth doing, and what do I have to show for them? Obviously I've learned a lot from those moments but I have nothing to show for it. They're all shoved off in an obscure folder somewhere on a long forgotten harddrive or been lost to time never to be seen again.</p>
          <p>It's here that I've come to the thought that I should go and create an archive, a gallery, or a portfolio of sorts that I can be proud of and show to the world. I have plans on what I want to do, but I see a long and difficult path ahead as I try my absolute best to use all I've learned about HTML and CSS to create a site that not only serves to hold my past projects, but also represent me. I spent a bit of my morning messing in Photoshop trying to get a layout done and have learned that there is a lot that has to be taken into account and it is more difficult than one could imagine. </p>
          <p>To end off this little post, I am thinking that I will just cobble something together that holds some of my past projects and expand on it bit by bit. It is better to have something down rather than nothing after all.</p>

          <p>...and we're up! I finally got around to updating my GitHub repo and now you're seeing the result of it all! I'm honestly surprised by the fact that this entire page isn't broken or messed up in some odd fashion seeing as I didn't account for differing resolutions or browsers when creating the styling on my laptop. It all seems to be in working condition though and now I can start focusing on populating the pages with whatever I find lying around in the archives.</p>
          <p>Maybe this is the start of a blog, the start of public web experiments, or nothing at all. Whatever it is that I do with this page I'll try and keep it all sorted out and avoid creating a tangled mess of a site.</p>
          <p>It's at this point of writing that I realise filling up an entire webpage is difficult. It's incredible how you can visit a news site and find a towering amount of text in a single article. Although it seems most sites like to squish the text in a column that's like 25% of the screen width and break up paragraphs with pictures or ads, anything that can fill up space. You know, I should probably do that to make the page seem more content rich! But what to use for that purpose... it's a tough call, but I'll see what I can find.</p>

          <h3>Some delicious sgehtti...</h3>
          <p>Alright I think that's enough dilly-dallying it's time to end this post. In summary, I'm aiming to consistently update this site and create actual content. It'll be nice to have saved up if I ever need a portfolio and give me some further experience in programming. Please look forward to whatever I do next, and thank you for reading this mess of a post.</p>
